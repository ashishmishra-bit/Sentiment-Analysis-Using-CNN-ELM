Aww that is so kind of them :) I would&#39;ve done the same specially for someone I love, you can&#39;t say they&#39;re dumb or stupid for doing it unless you know someone going thru some thing like this I mean come on wouldn&#39;t you do the same for a loved one? Total respect to her besides she can always rock wigs no biggie!

Well, then they would be kicked off the team. I don&#39;t see why they would be, though. <a href="/swagpack_82">@swagpack_82</a>

Everyone who is saying eww and shit like that needs to stfu! They are doing this for a good cause and if you wouldn&#39;t shave your head for cancer then dont fucking say anything! These woman are beautiful no matter what! If you can&#39;t show some respect towards them then you have no heart! Now stop talking shit and lighten up!

Dude, before you start being disrespectful to a lady, you need to READ ALL MY COMMENTS not just 1 and then misread it. This is 2 days old, don&#39;t drag me into it. Now, how about you get some respect and learn how to come at people correctly. Okay? Everyone is entitled to an opinion. That&#39;s what this country was founded upon. Freedom. Personal freedom, religious freedom, etc. How about you &#34;GTFO&#39;, please. <a href="/amazika">@amazika</a>

Why? Cuz they aren&#39;t pretty enough? Just because they&#39;re bald doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not pretty. <a href="/swagpack_82">@swagpack_82</a>
