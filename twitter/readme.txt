This twitter dataset consists of the training and testing data of the baseline prediction system. The dataset contains 5 partitions to perform 5-fold cross-validation. The ground truth sentiment labels are stored in groundTruthLabel.txt. Note the image filenames are not continuous due to the removal of repetitive images (retweet) in the testing set. For each image, the corresponding txt file contains the hashtag in filename, and metadata including tweet text.
