4th and 29 conversion is a joke....a one yard check down for a first down is comical...when u combine te two it&#39;s not that funny....

And if u dont want to get rid of norv cuz of his relationship with rivers...then cut em both and tell em to kick rocks cuz at this point, with pretty much no hope left...im sellin my season tix and goin to the broncos games from hear on out. As a chargers fan, i will always hate eli! So im rootin for peyton to get anothrr ring this year and prove hes better than his mongloid brother. So since our season is in the shitter, and our front office is a bunch of douschebags who wont make any changes til the playoffs are pretty much outta reach...im changin my support to blue and orange for the season so peyton can get that monkey off his back and put eli in his place! Which is second to peyton and NOT even close to his brotgers

Again you guys black out the game that is BS. How do expect people to come if you guys keep losing. Think about the fans instead if your wallets. So damn selfish. <a href="/chargersdotcom">@chargersdotcom</a>

I mean this is sad. The Raiders are not blacking out there games. Giving there fans a chance to watch the game. Charger fans have to actually go the the stadium to watch the game. Instagram doesn&#39;t upload enough pics this is last weeks pic I mean what is this organization doing.
